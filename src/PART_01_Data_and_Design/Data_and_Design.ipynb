    "**SHORT DESCRIPTION:**\n",
    "This course contains several lectures and hands-on workshops for those who want to use data as design materials in the development of the design process. This course was basically designed for one semester. However, for six days, we will gently visit the critical concepts and implementations of the topics: Code, Data and processing, Geometry data, Vector, Raster, Regression, Classification, Pattern, Data Representation, Dimensionality Reduction, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Implementation, Mapping, and Visualization Methodologies. From the designer's perspective, we will better understand and implement the use of data and tools, finally, gain the holistic high-level concepts to expand that knowledge and technology further. The concepts and contents you will learn in this course would become a map for those who want to learn how to use data and digital medium in design."
