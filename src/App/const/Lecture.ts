  ## Code for Design

  #### [_Computational Design [Book]_](https://computationaldesign.tistory.com/49)
  * Korean, ~~English~~
  * **keywords:** Computational Design, Data, How to code for designers, Computational Design Thinking, Design Algorithm...  
  * **Research** An introduction to Computational Design for designers. This Book(P394) talks about data, design, and algorithms, how designers understand the paradigm shifts(with the 4th industrial revolution), and how to prepare for them. This book helps novice designers to start becoming computational designers. English version of it has been writing now.
  
  
  
  #### [_Computational Design Thinking for Designers_](./MD/Lecture%20Computational%20Design%20Thinking%20for%20Designers.md)
  * Korean, English 
  * **keywords:** Computational Design, Data, How to code for designers, Design algorithm, Computational Thinking ...  
  * **These keywords** could help traditional designers to start thinking like computational design specialists. Computational thinking in design asks you holistic approaches to resolve a small design problem while also asking you an extremely isolated process to fix a comprehensive design concern. These different policies and thinking levels become huddles to understand computational design processes for designers.
  
  
  #### [_Data in Design_](./MD/Lecture%20DataDesignComputationalDesign.md)
  * Korean, English
  * **keywords:** Computational Design, Data, How to code for designers, Design algorithm, Computational Thinking ...  
  * **Data** is becoming increasingly available for specialists and designers in diverse ways as a new material in the 21st century. Data's importance has led to the new age of design, making holistic design approaches in architectural, landscape, and urban design possible: Optimization, parametric design, data-driven design, and something fundamentally reliant on data. Therefore, the use of data in design is becoming much more significant than ever. Mainly, the change in our life by autonomous vehicles, IoT, blockchain, or smart cities based on 5G technology will accelerate the way of living and thinking, generating and consuming data every day. This lecture shows some snippets of How designers could surf with this new wave
  
  
  
  #### [_How to code for designers_](https://computationaldesign.tistory.com/37)
  * Korean, ~~English~~
  * **keywords:** Computational Design, Data, How to code for designers, Design algorithm, Computational Thinking ...  
  * **This lecture series** is for the freshman in architectural design school. It helps students understand and harness hardware and software technology in design process as tools, particularly how to use data as design materials and code the design process with the data as instructions.
  
  
  
  #### [_GIS, Data and Design_](https://youtu.be/QLesjWC443c)
  * ~~Korean~~, English
  * **keywords:** GIS, Data, Computational design ...  
  * **This lecture** talks about data in design, showing different examples and how to manipulate spatial information in design processes. Students understand the importance of data in design and use it as a design materials
  
  
  
  #### [_Numeric Network Analysis Post COVID 19 Urbanism_](./MD/Lecture%20Numeric%20Network%20Analysis%20Post%20COVID%2019%20Urbanism.md)
  * Korean, English
  * **keywords:** Urban data, Network algorithm, Design algorithm ...  
  * **This course** investigates diverse quantitative methods to measure and analyze emerging urban spatial issues of COVID-19 relevant to contemporary urban planning and design practice. The lecture teaches spatial network analytics approaches that offer students learning tools(Python and RhinoGH) and an understanding of the data and the process for integrating pedestrian flow information and decision-making with urban planning and design solutions.
  
  
  
  #### [Geometry as Data Structure and Visualization](https://nj-namju.medium.com/geometry-as-data-structure-and-visualization-48bcfdea3851)
  * Korean, English
  * **keywords:** Computational geometry, Data, Design algorithm, Computational Design Thinking ...  
  * **Geometry** is essential data as design materials; understanding the basic concept of computational geometry, geometries as data structures, and how to contrive the logical development systems as design processes for your purpose.
  
  
  
  #### [_HTML Canvas Optimization of Rendering Loop_](./MD/Lecture%20HTML%20Canvas%20Optimization%20of%20Rendering%20Loop.md)
  * ~~Korean~~, English
  * **keywords:** Data visualization, Real-time Graphics, Pipeline, HTML Canvas, Mapping ...  
  * **This article** talks about a technical solution for a real-time rendering loop with HTML Canvas API for digital mapping or data visualization and how to set up and optimize the rendering pipeline based on a web-based visualization app.
  
  
  
  #### [_Clustering Points: Collision-Based Dynamic Grid Graph method_](./MD/Lecture%20Clustering%20Points%20Collision%20Based%20Dynamic%20Grid%20Graph%20method.md)
  * ~~Korean~~, English
  * **keywords:** Mapping, Clustering Data, Visualization, Methodology ...  
  * **Research** for clustering point data in digital mapping: This article states a clustering algorithm for dynamic points at different zoom levels on digital mapping. Urban, landscape, or architectural designers could use this methodology to represent data as visual groups or to reveal insights from data while interacting with data directly on the stage of analysis and decision-making process.
