# Data & Design, AI for Urban Data and Visualization

### Data, Design Computation, Artificial Intelligence, Visualization, Harvard GSD J Term 2023


**KEYWORD:**

Vector, Raster, Urban Data, GIS, Data Processing, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Visualization, Mapping, Design Decision-Making ...

**SHORT DESCRIPTION:**

This course contains several introductory lectures and hands-on workshops for those who want to use data as design materials to develop the design process. 

This course was basically designed for a one-year long period. However, for a few days, we will gently visit the basic concepts and implementations of the topics: Code, Data and processing, Geometry data, Vector, Raster, and some machine learning models and their related technologies, such examples: Regression, Classification, Pattern, Data Representation, Dimensionality Reduction, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Implementation, Mapping, and Visualization Methodologies. 

From the designer's perspective, we will better understand and implement the use of data and tools, finally, gain the holistic high-level concepts to expand that knowledge and technology further. Therefore, the ideas and contents you will learn in this course could become a map for those who want to learn how to use data and digital media in design.

Since we have limited time, each day, students will learn individual topics listed below. Then, students will make a group to discuss, help, understand, and finish homework and examples. All code and examples will be online, and the instructor will be available before and after class for troubleshooting.

In addition, it is also possible for an individual or group to focus on one of the primary topics and revisit other topics after the course based on the student's ability and expectations. It is yours if you are interested in data as a design material.
