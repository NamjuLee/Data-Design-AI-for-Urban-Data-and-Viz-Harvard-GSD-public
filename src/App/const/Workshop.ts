# Workshop Series


#### [_Discrete Urban Space and Connectivity_](./MD/Workshop%20Discrete%20Urban%20Space%20and%20Connectivity.md)
* Korean, English
* **Keywords:** Data Structure, Graph, Matrix, Pixel, Voxel, Discretization, Partition, Connection, Search
* **Graph** is a mathematical object that consists of sets of points and edges dealing with discrete information. Graph is widely used for computation, discrete mathematics, or representing relational data structures. It has an explicit relationship among vertices by edges visualizing the topological aspect, such as a street network of urban, highway, or subway map, whose graphs closely resemble their physical form due to their characteristics. A graph is a useful tool for dealing with spatial information, including geometry in design process.


#### [_Immersive Environmental Information Visualization_](./MD/Workshop%20Immersive%20Environmental%20Information%20Visualization.md)
* Korean, English
* **Keywords:** Unity3d, C# scripting, data, Real-time graphics, Geometries, implementation, data and Interaction, Pipeline...
* **Description:** This workshop will introduce the fundamentals of data visualization strategies in the Unity game engine. The attendees will learn how to import weather data from an open-source API and display the acquired data over an interactive map using several immersive visualization strategies through lectures and hands-on exercises.


#### [_Introduction to Computational Design Data, Geometry, and Visualization Using Digital Media_](./MD/Workshop%20IntroductionToComputationalDesignDataGeometryVisualization.md)
* Korean, English
* **Keywords:** Computational Geometry, Visualization, Urban and Architectural Data, web-based
* **This** is a hands-on workshop and lecture series about the Introduction to Computational Design for Data and Geometry Visualization for Digital Mapping on the Web. This workshop is for those interested in developing the ideas and skills of data and geometry visualization to understand the data in architectural or urban contexts. The workshop consists of three key parts: (1) processing and visualizing data, (2) constructing geometries (3) developing a pipeline for an interactive mapping system. Using HTML canvas and ArcGIS JSAPI, we will understand the holistic process and the pipeline of data and geometry visualization and mapping. Key coding demos and related lectures will happen in the workshop, and coding exercises with the boilerplate code will be followed as homework after the workshop.
